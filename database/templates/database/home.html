<h4>About</h4>
<p>
    I was employed for 27 years with the Systematic Entomology Laboratory,
    Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture from
    1990â”€2016. Although my responsibilities focused mainly on research on the
    Lepidoptera, I had experience working on Hemiptera (True Bugs), Aphididae
    (Sternorrhyncha), and phytophagus Acari.
</p>
<p>
    Since retirement, I became a Research Associate stationed at the National
    Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, USA.
    And I continue to do research on the Lepidoptera, primarily on the Gelechioidea.
</p>
<p>
    My ongoing projects include: plylogenetics of the world Blastobasidae,
    including evolution of host-plant preferences and biogeography; Moths of
    America north of Mexico (MONA) fascicle on Blastobasidae, and many
    alpha-taxonomic and life-history studies on Nearctic, Neotropical, and
    Indo-Asian Gelechioidea.
</p>
<p>
    I am and remain eager to collaborate with anyone who desires identifications
    of taxa within my expertise, including life-history studies or general collecting.
